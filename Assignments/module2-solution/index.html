                <p>
                    (Born February 17, 1963). He attended Laney High School and would go on to attend University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where he played for coach Dean Smith. The 6'6 shooting guard would get drafted 3rd overall in the famous 1984 draft by the Chicago Bulls. He quickly established himself as one of the most elite scorers, defenders and athlete that the league had ever seen. He would go on to 3 peat on 2 separate occasions, the first from 1991-93 and the second from 1996-98. He finished his 15 year career as arguably the greatest player of all time as he was a 10x scoring champion, 6-0 in the Finals with a Finals MVP for each championship, 5x MVP, 14x All star, and a DPOY to list a few of his accolades.

                <p>
                    (August 23, 1978-January 26, 2020) A 6'6 shooting guard from Lower Merion High school, he was the 13th overall pick in the stacked 1996 draft by the Charlotte Hornets straight out of high school. He was traded to the Lakers some weeks later where he would go on to play 20 years. In that time span, he was paired up almost immediately with Shaquille O'Neal, forming one of the most dynamic duos in league history as they would 3 peat from 2000-02. By the time the pair split up in 2004, Kobe had established himself as one of the deadliest scorers in league history and the best shooting guard in a post-Jordan Bulls era. Upon the Shaq trade, Kobe would further establish himself as an all time great as he would become a back to back scoring champion, an MVP, win back to back titles and was a back to back Finals MVP all within a 5 year span. When his career was over, Kobe was a 5x champion, 1x MVP, 2x scoring champion, 12x All-Defensive team, 18x All star and a 15x All-NBA player, with 11 being all-NBA 1st team.

                <p>
                    (Born December 30, 1984) A 6'9 forward from St. Vincent-St. Mary was the 1st overall pick in the popular 2004 draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers. The highly touted prospect dubbed "The Chosen One", would far exceed expectations with the numerous accolades he has accrued over the years. In his first stint with the Cavs, he would make a Finals appearance in 2007 and would go on to win back to back MVPs, but could not win it all. In 2010 he would decide to take his talents to the Miami Heat where he'd join up with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh to win back to back titles, MVPs and Finals MVPs in 2012 and 13. He would return to Cleveland to win the city its only NBA championship in 2016, upsetting the Warriors by coming back from a 3-1 Finals deficit, a feat never done on the Finals stage. He would join the Lakers in 2018 and is currently in the Finals with Anthony Davis seeking his 4 championship.
